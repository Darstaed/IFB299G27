<h1>Privacy Guidelines</h1>

<p> We at David's Real Estate are serious about making sure that your private information is secure including
phone numbers and email addresses. Therefore, it is important that you as a user follow these suggestions. </p>

<h5> Secure Password </h5>
<p> Creating the right password can make sure that no one apart from yourself accesses your profile. Make sure that
your password is unique, but also memorable enough so that you remember it. Use a separate password to what you use
on other sites. And lastly, do not share your password with anyone. </p>

<h5> Logging Out </h5>
<p> Make sure that you log out of your profile as soon as you are done. Click log out on the top left hand side of the
